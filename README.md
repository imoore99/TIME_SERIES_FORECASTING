## Time Series Forecasting with Statsmodels

#### Financial Data Prediction & Trend Analysis

##### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

- Purpose: Develop and compare multiple time series forecasting models for financial data prediction, implementing both traditional statistical methods and modern machine learning approaches.
- Objective: Build robust forecasting framework that handles trend, seasonality, and volatility patterns in financial time series data while providing confidence intervals and forecast accuracy metrics.

##### BUSINESS PROBLEM:

Credit risk forecasting require accurate forecasting for risk management, portfolio optimization, and strategic planning. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle with complex financial data characteristics including non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and structural breaks. This project evaluates multiple forecasting approaches to identify optimal methods for different financial time series patterns.

##### DATA SOURCES:

- Primary: Financial time series data (stock prices, economic indicators, market indices)
- Features: Price data, volume, volatility measures, and technical indicators
- Frequency: Daily, weekly, and monthly observations
- Validation: Out-of-sample testing with walk-forward analysis

##### KEY FINDINGS & RESULTS:

- Model Comparison: Evaluated ARIMA, SARIMA, and a generalized mean-reverting methodology
- Volatility Prediction: Successfully captured volatility clustering with GARCH-enhanced models
- Confidence Intervals: Developed reliable uncertainty quantification for risk management applications
- Business Impact: Enhanced forecasting accuracy supports improved investment and risk management decisions

##### TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Core Stack:

- Python - Primary development environment
- pandas/numpy - Data manipulation and numerical computing
- statsmodels - ARIMA, SARIMAX, and traditional econometric models
- scikit-learn - Machine learning models and validation framework

Forecasting Libraries:
